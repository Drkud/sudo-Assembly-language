day 1, apr 11 2024

I am diving back in to cpus because a friend of my is writing their own cpu. this is not the first time or the second but the third trying to make a cpu in a programing langue.

I am think this is how to we be broken up

1. make the logic gates class
2. make the the gates in to an alu
3. make my own cpu arcture
4. build the cpu 
5. make the cpu be able to run a custom langue (brad++ )
5. make a hello world program use the custom langue.

I think I can does this in time

Starting coding

I made the logic gates I though that I was going to have a warper class but I didn't do that I make the basic gates and not or xor with that I made a tristate.

day 2 apr 29 2024 

I finsih my memory class I am using ints for speed and strings 



Day 3 May 16 2024

I am working on my cu and reigters trying to get in to a state where it can my some back code for it . I made all of the function I think that I am going to use the the xBraden langue I made it so next is the var that gets update after ever function unless it is moving the pointer , I made 3 reigters the first one is the fucntion type then the requmenits.

Day 4 may 17 2024 
I going to make the cpu be able to run some code or workable that means I havae to connect the functions to the function that the user uses.

day 5? may 20th
I got it to work and it is turing comptele the probem is that it's hard to code. the way I read the scirpt file means that the spircted is comptled in the memory and than ran. The problem with this is that it's hard to write in the loction you didn't start making loops near impossable but I am trying to make the code work better by using jmp to move the memory to that point when the code is being read.
I got it to work so now I can write my first function using some odd code . I made a basic adding "function" and now I am tring to make a fib function this is the sorcue code 
1000
x is 900
y is 909
set 900 1
set 901 1
set 902 1
set 201 1
set 200 10
jmp 2000
lt 201 200
jmp 100
#now we are in the 100's
mov 900 902
add 900 901
mov 902 901
outi 900 900
inc 201
jmp 2000

so if the start of a line is not a key word then it is a commoit so what I am doing is set 900 to 902 to numbers and then 200 and 201 to how many times the code runs so 

I am thinking of making vals so that it is easyer to do things and not use memory pointers 

I am at the point where this project is at a place where it is done but I can do more but doing for is 40 + hours of work for a small change or 100 + hours for a big change rewrite this copy of the code . so what I can do is a display , greater order functions have the ablitiy to use the key word to make functions not work a round to do this I will need to incease the regiers. 

day 6 21 may 
The plan that I am going to do is this I am going to keep what I have incase I need to fall back but what I am going to do is rewrite a lot of this to use userinput , a cui ,and more reigters I am thinking 6 or 8, what this means is that I can make greater functions and have the ablitiy to make funtion and not have to use memory as the scoure of the input and output my time est is about 100 hours. but it probaly less than that 
I made the reigters quickly but the problem that I am having is that there is two way that I can go and one is say that ever key word is 8 bytes long ever time or go down a hole of fight pointers I am choosing right now to say they are all 8 bytes long .

so i am working on a def and end key words so that i can put all of the stuff in the function inside of the lamnda that get put in the hashmap that is going to be used to run the that function.*


Day7 3 june 
first day of the summer I am going to make a system that can be a display. so the addresses 100 to 356 are going to be display . how it is going to works is that the output will display on or off if the int is greater or less than 0. I going to code this in the the base doc. I think that I finished it using the picture class from stdlib

So I am doing the hard part where I am make a system where function can maked in the langue it's self. to do this I have to set up a 

9/7/24

I need to fix up the project for the fair a make a program in the launge. i fix the code and the basic scirpt worked. How I did it was by using spilt method build into java and prasaing them in to ints and decoding the string for the array for the method.
